              <p style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>(1)</strong> DotLive owns and operates a platform in Nigeria that allows merchants to rent their apartments to the public over the internet. This platform is currently provided on the website <span style="color: red;">https://dotlive.com.ng</span>, but may be provided on different websites or applications in the future.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> The merchant will have the opportunity to sell their apartments on the DotLive platform. DotLive is entitled to accept purchases on behalf of the agent or landlord. The service provided by DotLive is limited to referring customers to the merchant and accepting orders and payments on their behalf. In addition to this at DotLive's discretion they may provide the merchant with analytics about the performance of the merchants's apartments and additional marketing support. This support may be reflective of the agreed level of commission.<br/><br/>

<strong>(3)</strong> The merchant authorises DotLive to accept binding orders from customers on their behalf.<br/><br/>

<strong>(4)</strong> DotLive may carry out changes to the website or service, or suspend the service, without notice.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;"> DotLive's rights and obligations</span></strong><br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> DotLive will present on the website the apartments listed by the agent or landlord. The merchant will be responsible for listing their own apartments.<br/><br/>

<strong>(3)</strong> DotLive is authorised to accept binding sales on behalf of the merchant and will be careful to pass order data on to the merchant as well as technology allows.<br/><br/>

<strong>(4)</strong> In order to maintain its reputation for quality and high standard of service, DotLive reserves the right to terminate the relationship with the merchant if the merchant repeatedly receives bad reviews or complaints, or fails to comply with our recommendations.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;"> Merchant's rights and obligations</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> The merchant is obliged to provide all the information necessary when listing a product on DotLive.com.ng. This should include but is not limited to, a detailed title and sub-title, price, quantity, picture and description.

<strong><span style="color: red;"> Commission</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> The merchant agrees to pay DotLive a fixed percentage commission on the gross revenue from their sales made through the DotLive platform. Depending on the category it may be appropriate to agree different commission percentages for certain items or product categories.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> DotLive may start charging additional fees for the sale of goods through the DotLive platform at any point. These may include but are not limited to, listing fees, multiple photos fees and enhanced marketing fees.

<strong>(3)</strong> DotLive reserves the right to adjust the percentage commission, providing suitable notice is served in advance to the merchant. DotLive will give the merchant adequate notice of any commission changes, in writing. This does not cover adjustments that constitute a material change of the contract terms, which would require an additional agreement on the change.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">Customer online payment</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> In case of electronic payment by the customer (e.g. by credit card, debit card, or Wireless online Transfer), DotLive collects the payment for the relevant order in DotLive's name on behalf of the merchant, and pays it out to the merchant according to the invoicing agreement.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> The merchant will keep receipts of deliveries to customers for at least 13 months and make those available on request. In case of problems that may cause the order to be rescinded, or in case of a delivery failure, the merchant must immediately notify DotLive by phone so that the credit card payment may be cancelled.<br/><br/>

<strong>(3)</strong> The merchant bears the risk of abuse of the payment medium (e.g. of credit card or debit card fraud). If a fraudulent payment has been credited to the merchant, DotLive reserves the right to correct the amount the merchant is invoiced to offset this payment.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">Invoicing and merchant payment</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> DotLive's invoices may be delivered by email, online, fax, post or in person. They include DotLive's claims on the merchant, commission, and, if applicable, other fees<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> DotLive is to send a monthly statement of confirmed orders to the Supplier by the 10th of each month after which the supplier will have 5 days for verification and commission settlement.<br/><br/>


<strong><span style="color: red;">Liability</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> The merchant indemnifies DotLive from all claims arising in relation to matters outside DotLive's control, including but not limited to the quality of goods and services provided by the agent or landlord. The merchant further indemnifies DotLive from third parties' claims resulting from any violation of laws and regulations by the agent or landlord.<br/><br/>

<strong>(3)</strong> VAT liability rests with the merchant and DotLive will not be responsible for any VAT issues.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">Privacy</span></strong><br/><br/>

Both parties are obliged to treat confidentially the content of this agreement, as well as all other information and data they acquire in connection with the partnership, and not use it for purposes outside the scope of this contract or pass it on to third parties. This obligation is in force for 1 year after the termination of the contract. Both parties are obliged to follow privacy laws and handle accordingly all data related to customers, suppliers and business partners.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">Licence</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> DotLive has the right to freely maintain the merchant's listing and its ranking on the website. DotLive offers customers the opportunity to give ratings and reviews of the merchant's goods and services on the website, and has the right but not the obligation to publish these online and make them visible to all customers. DotLive reserves the right to delete ratings and reviews.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> DotLive may scan, transcribe, and publish online the merchant's listings, logos and other materials required. The merchant grants to DotLive a royalty- free, perpetual, unrestricted licence to use and distribute any materials provided by him, for the purpose of advertising DotLive's service. In particular, this includes use in Google AdWords campaigns, domain name registrations and other online marketing and search engine optimization measures.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">Terms and termination</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> This agreement is valid as soon as the merchant signs the contract, or fulfils an order referred by DotLive, and remains valid indefinitely, until termination by either party. Termination can occur at any time, with a period of notice of one month, in writing, by email, post or fax. The revenues generated during this notice period are still subject to the partnership agreement. The right to immediate termination by either party for important cause remains unaffected.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> The right to immediate termination in particular covers the case where the merchant repeatedly receives negative ratings and reviews on the website, and when these are not obviously unjustified. Repeatedly providing misleading information or withholding information required to present the merchant's items is also grounds for immediate termination. Typos, mistakes and transmission errors are excluded from this, as long as they are not caused with intent or by gross negligence.<br/><br/>

<strong><span style="color: red;">General</span></strong><br/><br/>

<strong>(1)</strong> If a single clause in this agreement is invalid, both parties will endeavor to replace the invalid clause by a valid one that reproduces as closely as possible the intended economic meaning of the invalid clause. The validity of the rest of the agreement remains unaffected. This applies in particular if the agreement is found to be incomplete.<br/><br/>

<strong>(2)</strong> DotLive reserves the right to modify his general terms and conditions without giving any justification. In that case, DotLive will give the merchant adequate notice via email. The notice will contain advice on the right and period of objection to the changes, and on the consequences of leaving unexercised the right to object.<br/><br/>

<strong>(3)</strong> The changed terms and conditions are considered agreed by the merchant if he does not object to them in writing within 2 weeks of receiving notice of the changes.<br/><br/>

<strong>(4)</strong> Any terms and conditions of the merchant are not part of this agreement unless DotLive expressly agrees to adhere to them in writing</p>
